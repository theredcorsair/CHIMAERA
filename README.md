# TheWayoftheExpertGeneralist
This is a suggested path on how to apply the 'Renaissance Approach' to becoming an Expert Generalist and using this mindset during red team engagements or hunt/incident response etc..
In this section I will include lessons and phases that I want you to participate in. I will give credit when due to the author/source. This will be a very long process because you cannot develop the mindset overnight. It took me 20+ years to develop this mindset, many of these were by chance.
I will not sugarcoat it, there is a good chance that some of you may never attain/achieve this mindset. The very least that will happen is that you will develop a defense mindset, where recognition of tactics and strategic moves can be noticed. However, you would be unable to develop strategies and tactics on whims and hunches as quickly as others.

Some points to remember for both sides set by Thrawn:

“Failure to act always brings consequences. But sometimes, those consequences can be turned to one’s advantage.”

 “the best path didn’t have to be quick as long as it was correct.” 
 
 “One is born with a unique set of talents and abilities. One must choose which of those talents to nurture, which to set aside for a time, which to ignore completely. Sometimes” 
 
  “A great tactician creates plans. A good tactician recognizes the soundness of a plan presented to him. A fair tactician must see the plan succeed before offering approval. Those with no tactical ability at all may never understand or accept it. And when a mind is too deficient in understanding, the resulting gap is often filled with resentment. —” 
  
  And one of the most important: 
  
  “No one is immune from failure. All have tasted the bitterness of defeat and disappointment. A warrior must not dwell on that failure, but must learn from it and continue on.
